00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:50,816
Some of us are pleased
with these small triumphs.

158
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:55,855
Others have loftier aspirations ...
passion, even.

159
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,257
Our founder ... he had his tesseract.

160
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:00,593
As for me, well, it
would be an understatement

161
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,330
to say that I've waited my whole life
to get possession of the Obelisk,

162
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,799
<i>to harness its power.</i>

163
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:12,145
- Dr. Simmons, is it?
- Yes.

164
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,674
Bakshi tells me you have a passion
for these things yourself.

165
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:19,512
In your opinion, where did
Dr. Lingenfelter go wrong?

166
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:23,816
I-I'm not entirely sure that she did.

167
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:26,285
That's one among us. 
Please, clarify.

168
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:32,424
Well, it ... it's just we're
dealing with alien technology.

169
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:35,339
Alien metals interact with biology
on a cellular level

170
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,898
in a way that's impossible
to replicate without a sample.

171
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,300
But if we were to acquire
the Obelisk itself,

172
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,503
would it then be possible
to weaponize its effects?

173
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:52,511
- I would think so, yes.
- Excellent.

174
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,814
I want everyone prepared when we do.

175
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,052
[sighs] 
He knows your name.

176
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,688
Do you have any idea what this means?

177
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:07,560
We could kill millions of
people, perhaps even billions.

178
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:10,996
Pretty awesome, huh?

179
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:19,160
[indistinct conversations]

180
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,371
Don't mind me just standing here.

181
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,673
Fitz: Did Skye just steal
that painting from our lab?

182
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:29,511
Mack certainly has an impressive
physique, wouldn't you say?

183
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,981
- Bugger off.
- No. It's true.

184
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,482
Look at him. 
He's quite a lot of a man.

185
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,483
[speaking indistinctly]

186
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,752
Well, obviously I agree,

187
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,754
what with you being my
subconscious and everything.

188
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,158
What? I can say that to you.
It doesn't mean anything.

189
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,193
It's just a casual observation.
 That's all it is.

190
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,861
- No, I know that.
- Yeah.

191
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,763
Well, why are you still staring at me?

192
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,632
Because you just admitted
that I'm not real.

193
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,100
Oh, please.

194
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,335
I'm not gonna have this
conversation with myself again.

195
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,437
Fitz, this is a good thing.

196
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,107
You've got friends now, real friends.

197
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,143
- You don't need me anymore.
- Yeah, but I miss you.

198
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:05,514
I mean, I still... miss her.

199
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,884
But she left and moved on.

200
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:12,988
Maybe it's time you do the same.

201
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,906
I was a fat baby.

202
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,976
You know this is, like, a
religious painting, right?

203
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:37,379
Yeah, well, when aliens started
scribbling on the back of it,

204
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,115
it kind of voided god's warranty,
as far as I'm concerned.

205
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:41,717
I just wish I knew what
that scribbling meant.

206
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,853
The director won't be much help.

207
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,487
Do you think I was wrong to press?

208
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,356
No, on the contrary,
couldn't agree more.

209
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,925
Reminded me of how I used to
put the screws to my old lady.

210
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,694
- It's not like that.
- [chuckling] No?

211
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,029
Then why put yourself
in Coulson's cross hairs?

212
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,832
Because Coulson used to be different.
He wasn't always so closed off.

213
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,169
[sighs] I'm telling you,
my ex was the same way ...

214
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,938
always keeping secrets.
Drove me absolutely mental.

215
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,716
There really is only one way
to handle people like that.

216
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,199
Dig deeper.

217
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,835
Invade their privacy till
they go crazy themselves.

218
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,838
Wow.
Thanks for the advice, divorced guy.

219
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:15,675
All I'm saying is there's
something Coulson doesn't

220
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,444
want you to know. Maybe you
should find out what it is.

221
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,380
- And how do you suggest I do that?
- Well, don't know exactly.

222
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,482
But it seems your HYDRA
boyfriend downstairs

223
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,257
would be a good place to start.

224
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:34,593
<i>- Ward: I'm surprised it took you so long.
- This isn't about that.</i>

225
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,229
Come on, Skye.

226
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't pretend you haven't
thought about what I said.

227
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,935
Yeah, well, I'm pretty
sure you're the last person

228
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,603
I'd ever want to talk
to about my father.

229
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,071
Not if you want to find him.

230
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,174
My parents were killed
in the Hunan province,

231
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,176
along with everyone
else in their village.

232
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:53,879
- That's not what happened.
- I know what you're doing.

233
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,347
I'm just trying to help.

234
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:58,217
No, you're exploiting a
weakness, looking for a way in.

235
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:01,020
I told you ...
 I will never lie to you...

236
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,456
- ...not again.
- Okay.

237
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:07,560
If you're really being
honest, name your source.

238
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,328
What?

239
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:10,796
If you have information about my father,

240
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:12,431
tell me where it came from ...
it's that simple.

241
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,403
Raina.

242
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:20,606
[chuckles]

243
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,842
She knows him, Skye.

244
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,477
No, I believe that you think she does.

245
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:28,647
Oh. Do you not get it?
Raina played you.

246
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:32,384
She found your weakness and
then used it against you.

247
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:34,086
- Skye ...
- Shut up, Ward.

248
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:37,356
I don't want to hear you
say another word about it.

249
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:42,294
Good.

250
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,899
Tell me what you know about this.

251
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,268
I first saw that when
we were in Belarus ...

252
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:51,170
me and you ... and later on,

253
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,872
when Garrett started
etching that in the glass.

254
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:58,711
Garrett carved this stuff himself?
Did he say what it was?

255
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:01,013
No, but he wasn't making a lot of sense

256
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,849
after he was injected
with the GH-formula.

257
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:12,858
These writings ...
they're not yours, are they?

258
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,897
Good.

259
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,133
That's good, 'cause once Garrett
started, he couldn't stop.

260
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,068
The writing was anywhere
he could carve it ...

261
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:26,672
- on the walls, on the floor.
- On his desk.

262
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,973
To be honest,

263
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,608
I was almost relieved when
S.H.I.E.L.D. put him down.

264
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,144
The Garrett I knew was long
gone once the writing started.

265
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,879
And whatever took his place,

266
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:38,276
I don't think it was meant to survive.

267
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,364
[music]

268
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:07,046
[sighs]

269
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,347
[device beeps]

270
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:11,150
HYDRA pursuing alien WMD technology.

271
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:15,487
Must act quickly to prevent
extinction-level event.

272
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:18,824
[sighs]
Awaiting further instructions.

273
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:19,925
Fish tacos.

274
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,493
[device beeps]

275
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,177
The reason you won't name your source
is because you are the source.

276
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:40,145
By all means, come on in.

277
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:44,951
Please, I know it's you,
so just be honest with me.

278
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:49,121
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

279
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,057
Because once Garrett started writing,
he went kind of nuts.

280
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,025
I see you've been talking to Ward.

281
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,831
I told you ... I'm fine.
May's been keeping an eye on me.

282
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:01,667
When did you start doing this?

283
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,370
First night I saw Garrett's writings ...

284
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:06,805
it just triggered something in me.

285
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:11,443
- What do you think caused it?
- The GH-formula, most likely.

286
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,813
Garrett and I were both injected ...
not a coincidence.

287
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,249
Yeah, but so was I, and I haven't
written anything like that.

288
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,051
Which is either very good,

289
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,587
or a whole different kind of scary,

290
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,890
which is why we had to monitor you.

291
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,728
Whoa. Wait. Monitor?
That is a very specific word.

292
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:30,896
We didn't tell you about this

293
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,565
because we wanted to
passively observe ...

294
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,367
see if the writing would
trigger something in you.

295
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,902
So, what ... you guys put, like,

296
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,705
- tiny hidden cameras in my bunk?
- Not in your bunk, but

297
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,274
I think you're focusing
on the wrong details here.

298
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:45,811
- I didn't react the same way.
- Right.

299
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,913
I believe Garrett and I
had a negative reaction

300
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,448
to the alien DNA in our system.

301
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:54,119
Maybe you didn't... 
because it was already there.

302
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,655
Yeah, right, like I'm an alien.

303
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,360
Hold on.
Are you saying that I am an alien?

304
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:04,630
- It's a theory...
- No, a theory is what scientists use

305
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:06,165
to prove things in nature.

306
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:08,634
This is you telling me that 
I might be an alien!

307
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:11,570
That is not something you just
say like it is no big deal.

308
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:15,040
- I was trying not to rattle you.
- Well, guess what ... epic fail.

309
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:20,245
- Coulson, you have a call on line 1.
- Really not a good time.

310
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:22,680
You're gonna want to take this call.

311
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:28,854
- Hello.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

312
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,989
<i>Somehow, I suspect that's the point.</i>

313
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,057
What do you want, Raina?

314
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,293
To meet.

315
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,429
You and I have something
to discuss, Agent Coulson.

316
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:40,599
<i>The matter is quite urgent.</i>

317
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,702
[alarm blaring]

318
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,439
<i>Everyone, listen up.</i>

319
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:49,575
I need each of you to
step away from your desk

320
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,443
and place your hands behind your back.

321

<i>Morse: Keep everyone off
their phones and tablets.</i>

322
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,848
We have a mole, ladies and gentlemen,

323
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:59,351
right here in our very facility.

324
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,519
[device beeps]

325
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,154
Someone has been sending
S.H.I.E.L.D. messages

326
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:03,922
right under our noses.

327
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,824
<i>I specialize in finding them.</i>

328
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:10,095
Bakshi here ...
well, he makes them suffer.

329
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:13,799
Until that happens... 
no one leaves.

330
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,768
HYDRA does not tolerate traitors.

331
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:21,903
<i>Anyone caught in
possession of contraband</i>

332
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,505
<i>will be punished accordingly.</i>

333
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,941
Dr. Jemma Simmons.

334
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,311
This is quite an impressive résumé ...

335
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,646
S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, top of your class,

336
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,682
two PHDs in very advanced fields.

337
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,252
It even says here you spent time in
the field as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

338
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,988
- Is that correct?
- Only a short time.

339
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:43,024
No. You've only been
in HYDRA a short time.

340
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,293
But it seems that you've been
affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D.

341
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,363
in one capacity or another
for most of your life.

342
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,467
To be fair,
aren't most HYDRA agents

343
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:53,435
ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives?

344
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,805
Who were working from within
S.H.I.E.L.D. long before it fell.

345
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,940
But there's no evidence
you supported HYDRA

346
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:00,775
while S.H.I.E.L.D. still existed.

347
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:04,312
In fact, it seems you were an
exemplary S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ...

348
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,449
perhaps even still are.

349
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,317
[sighs]

350
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:14,340
- My loyalties are with HYDRA.
- I'll be the judge of that.

351
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:24,666
Madam... there's
something you have to see.

352
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,267
Wait. Wait. That's ... 
That's not mine.

353
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,198
I-I-I've never seen
that before in my life!

354
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,072
I don't even know what that is!
What... I... [grunts]

from this intrusion.

359

We have been over this.

360
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,853
You and your staff will be
well compensated for your help.

361
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:05,223
Incoming at 4:00.

<i>Hunter: The tiny girl
in the flower dress?</i>

That's who everyone's
making such a fuss about?

364
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:27,712
- It's good to see you, Agent Coulson.
- Raina.

365
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,594
I was worried you weren't
going to accept my invitation...

366
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:46,264
but perhaps I wasn't the only one

367
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,711
looking forward to our next meeting.

368
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:54,172
- Is she hitting on him?
- Yep. That's what she does.

369
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,608
You implied there was
something urgent to discuss,

370
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:57,809
so here I am.

371
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:00,645
Either way, you're gonna
give me what I want.

372
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,449
You've changed, Agent Coulson.

373
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,584
Might just be circumstance,
considering last time,

374
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:08,820
you had me strapped into
your little memory machine.

375
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:11,089
I was only trying to help.

376
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:14,426
You want to help?
Tell me where to find the Obelisk.

377
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:17,162
I'm afraid it's out of my hands.

378
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:22,934
That really doesn't work for me.
I've seen what that thing can do.

379
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:25,537
It's too dangerous to
be out in the real world.

380
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:27,339
You've only seen the beginning.

381
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:32,310
Just because something's powerful
doesn't make it dangerous.

382
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,679
In this case, it's more
the death and destruction.

383
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,514
You must believe me, Agent Coulson ...

384
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:39,551
we want the same thing.

385
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:41,686
Unless it's an end to this conversation,

386
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:43,188
I'm pretty sure we don't.

387
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:48,093
You really know how to
make a girl feel special.

388
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,628
Only when I suspect she
has something up her sleeve.

389
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:53,932
It's in my purse, actually.
[chuckles]

390
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:58,303
Right now, HYDRA's looking
for a spy within their ranks.

391
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:02,073
I wonder what would
happen to Agent Simmons...

392
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,077
...if this were to fall
into the wrong hands.

393
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,513
Everything will be just fine.

Don't you seem nervous?

397
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:27,332
Well, maybe it has something to do

398
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,603
with you lurking right
outside of my stall.

399
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,105
Bakshi informed me that you
and Kenneth were lab partners.

400
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:38,176
We'd worked together on
a couple of assignments, yes.

401
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,577
Well, there are some who believe

402
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,212
that he may not have been acting alone.

403
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,915
Were you colluding with Kenneth?

404
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,317
[scoffs] No.
[chuckles]

405
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,869
Did you plant the flex
screen on Kenneth's desk?

406
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:53,792
No.
[chuckles]

407
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,860
You're not a very good liar, are you?

408
00:22:55,928 --> 00:22:58,496
Maybe I should take
a look at your hard drive,

409
00:22:58,564 --> 00:22:59,798
see what I find.

410
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,267
Go right ahead. It's
nothing but HYDRA files.

411
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,068
Oh, it better be.

412
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:07,705
I want you to keep something
in mind, Agent Simmons ...

413
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:12,343
HYDRA is everywhere.

414
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,482
Carry on.

415
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,986
[breathing deeply]

416
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,323
- I don't like being threatened.
- This isn't a threat.

417
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,592
It's a gesture of goodwill.

418
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,496
I would like nothing more
than to delete that photo.

419
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:35,266
And in return, what do you want?

420
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:39,003
From you?
Nothing.

421
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,641
But I will need to take Skye with me.

422
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,947
Excuse me?
What in the hell is this really about?

423
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:50,415
And why, also in the hell,

424
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,584
do you think I would ever 
let that happen?

425
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:55,086
To prevent every HYDRA employee

426
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:59,757
from receiving an automated
e-mail with that photo.

427
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:06,931
[beeps]

428
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:09,701
You have two minutes,

429
00:24:09,768 --> 00:24:13,638
after which, there's nothing I can do.

430
00:24:13,706 --> 00:24:15,673
Where are you planning to take Skye?

431
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:20,816
Somewhere she's always wanted to go....

432
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:25,083
...to meet her dad.

433
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:30,288
- She's lying.
- Ward said Raina knew him.

434
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:32,323
This cannot be a coincidence.

435
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:35,393
So you're what ... working
for Skye's father now?

436
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:40,231
I'm just trying to make the best
out of a difficult situation.

437
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,700
By threatening the life
of one of my agents?

438
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:47,739
By allowing one to find
out who she really is.

439
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,908
That's what Skye's been
searching for her whole life.

440
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:53,077
Ask her yourself, Agent Coulson.

441
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:56,981
She's here, isn't she ... listening?

442
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,552
<i>Skye needs to know that her
father loves her very much,</i>

443
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:04,435
<i>that she was taken from
him against his will,</i>

444
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,859
<i>that he's spent her entire
life searching for her.</i>

445
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:11,930
No matter how much you've
changed, Agent Coulson,

446
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,299
deep down, you're still a good man.

447
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:16,467
No good man would intentionally

448
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,770
keep a daughter from her father...

449
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:24,008
<i>especially when so much is at stake.</i>

450
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:27,412
You're running out of time.

00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:31,349
[beeping]

452
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,184
Give Skye what she's always wanted...

453
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:38,326
or else Agent Simmons dies.

454
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:42,760
[sighs]

455
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,123
No deal.

456
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,202
- Stand down, Skye.
- Were you not listening?

457
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,371
If I don't go out there,
Simmons is gonna die.

458
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,572
Coulson has a plan.

459
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,142
He also carves alien
writing into his desk,

460
00:25:57,177 --> 00:26:00,029
so maybe his judgment is
not what it used to be.

461
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,634
I said stand down.

462
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:06,584
Look, it's not too late.
We can fix this.

463
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,953
No one needs to get hurt.

464
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,926
[beeping]

What is happening?

475
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:42,681
Don't worry.
Coulson has a plan.

476
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,251
I can't believe

477
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,154
you would sacrifice
one of your own agents.

478
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:49,523
We all take risks in this business.

479
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:54,094
- In your case, it just didn't pay off.
- I had no choice.

480
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:59,399
Tiny violin's playing,
but no one's listening, sweetheart.

481
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:03,837
- Who's making you do this?
- HYDRA.

482
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:07,708
They want the Obelisk,
but you don't have it.

483
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:12,446
- Skye's father does.
- He won't stop until he gets her.

484
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:18,051
You're scared of him...
and you don't scare easily.

485
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,888
He's a very dangerous man.

486
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,725
You wouldn't believe the stories.

487
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,860
Well, now we've established

488
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:32,099
Skye's old man isn't father
of the year, what's next?

489
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,333
Take me in.

490
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:39,373
- Please.
- Sorry. No vacancies.

491
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,478
Once I walk out that door,
Whitehall will kill me.

492
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:48,812
It's possible. Or ...

493
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:51,552
maybe you and I will
work together after all.

494
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:54,221
- What?
- Tag and tail it is, then.

[air hisses]
[gasps]

496
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:03,430
- You're gonna use me to get to Whitehall.
- He'll be trying to find you.

497
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:05,499
Whether or not we're there
to save you when he does,

498
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:09,002
that's your call, depending on
how useful you make yourself.

499
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,906
You can start by telling us
how to find Skye's father.

500
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,358
<i>Simmons: I don't mean
to sound ungrateful,</i>

501
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:16,260
<i>because I am truly
grateful, but who are you?</i>

502
00:29:16,328 --> 00:29:17,695
Bobbi Morse.

503
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:20,731
Coulson sent me in to infiltrate
HYDRA and keep an eye on you.

504
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,199
Well, you did a spot-on job, really.

505
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:23,968
- You were quite intimidating.
- Sorry about that.

506
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,070
I had to assess other security
issues that were in play.

507
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:27,237
Yeah, like every HYDRA agent

508
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:30,174
- receiving an e-mail blowing my cover?
- Yeah, that was a curve ball.

509
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:32,076
I'm afraid there's no way I'm
walking out that front door.

510
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,511
Okay, don't worry.
All we have to do is get to the roof.

511
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,647
There's already an
extraction team there waiting.

512
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:38,782
Okay, just wait here.
It's all part of the plan.

513
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,985
All right?
[sighs]

514
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:46,757
We've been compromised.

515
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:50,126
I need you to abandon your
post and follow protocol 6-8-5.

516
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:55,566
[gasping]

517

[grunts]

519
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:00,237
- I told you there was a plan.
- I know.

520
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:04,541
- I'm sorry, but...
- Okay, go get to the roof. Go.

521
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:17,851
Where are they?

522
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:22,993
We're trapped.

523
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:25,963
Southwest corner!
Repeat, Southwest corner!

524
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:29,566
Get down!
[gunshots]

00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,642

Welcome back, Agent Simmons.
[breathing heavily]

530
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:08,439
Trip, it's so good to see you.

531
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:09,873
[breathes deeply]

532
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:13,110
You certainly know how to make
a first impression, Agent Morse.

533
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:15,713
- Please, it's just "Bobbi."
- Forgive me for asking,

534
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,182
but if you were able
to infiltrate HYDRA,

535
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:20,217
why even bother having me go in?

536
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,685
My cover gave me access
to HYDRA security,

537
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:22,953
but none of its high-level projects.

538
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:26,223
Then I'm afraid 
I came up empty-handed.

539
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,626
- Not entirely.
- My hard drive.

540
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:31,228
I took it after our
conversation in the bathroom.

541
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:33,997
Seemed like it might
provide some useful intel.

542
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:37,067
Oh. I like you.
[chuckles]

543

You ask me, Coulson let you off easy.

548
00:31:55,286 --> 00:32:00,324
- I didn't ask.
- Good luck out there, love.

549
00:32:02,427 --> 00:32:05,929
The address Raina gave us
is only a few blocks away.

550
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:09,232
[scoffs] And I thought she
chose this place for the ambiance.

00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:15,839
Remember what Lumley said about Skye?

554
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:18,776
"Wherever she goes, death follows"?

555
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:21,578
Yeah, that was a memorable quote.

556
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:24,014
Look, we know Skye's father has
been searching for her all this time.

557
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:27,885
What if he's what
Lumley is so afraid of?

558
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:29,019
[footsteps approach]

559
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,655
- Probably a trap, isn't it?
- Could be.

560
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:34,324
I'll need you running surveillance.
May, check the scanners.

561
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:37,194
Make sure local P.D.
aren't patrolling the area.

562
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:39,096
[device beeping] And, Skye ...

563
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:43,100
Where's Skye?

564
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,383
Hello?

565
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,919
Anyone here?

566
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:16,491
You wanted to meet.
Well, here I am.

567
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:45,166
Where did you go?

[cartridge clicks]

569
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:19,088
- So he was here.
- Yeah.

570
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:25,440
I just wanted a glimpse.

571
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:29,010
You're having one hell of a day, huh?

- The place has been cleared out ...

579

Must have left in a hurry.
Agent May's checking the back room.

Have you been drinking?

581
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,650
I was working.
Had to maintain my cover.

582

Your cover as what ... Ron Burgundy?

I can see why she frustrates you.

584

something you need to see.</i>

Looks like a small blade,
probably a scalpel.

And this is just pure strength.

Look at what he did.

590
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,128
I can't believe it.

591

No, no, no....

If it hadn't have been for Bobbi,
I would never have made it out.

622
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,179
- acting all uptight and evil.
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,886
You know what I could
really go for right now?

624
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,437
- Three-olive martini. Hold the olives.
- Hold the olives. Yeah.

625
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:03,124
<i>[chuckles] 
Hunter: Bobbi?</i>

626
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,095
Hey, Hunter. Nice suit.

627
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:11,832
"Nice suit"? Really?
That's what you're leading with?

628
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,734
What did you do to your hair?

629
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:17,071
- Ever heard of undercover?
- I prefer you blonde.

630
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:18,406
Well, I didn't do it for you.

631
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:20,841
Two seconds in ...
there's already a tone.

632
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:23,044
Th-this isn't a tone.
This is my speaking voice

633
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:24,845
when I'm upset with
an unreasonable person.

634
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:26,647
What's the deal there?

635
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:29,784
Hunter ever tell you stories
about his she-devil ex-wife?

636
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:32,563
All the time...
Damn.

637
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:35,156
Anyone mind telling me what the
bloody hell she's doing here?

638
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:37,940
- Bobbi's one of our best agents.
- Oh, that's rich!

639
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:39,593
Then mind telling me
what I'm doing here?

640
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:41,028
It's easy ... I vouched for you.

641
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:45,493
- Why the hell would you do that?!
- Play nice.

642
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,649
[sighs]

643
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,079
It's good to have Simmons back.

644
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:03,017
Which is why you should be down there.

645
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,852
I know you're gonna go after him.

646
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,821
- Skye ...
- No, it's okay. I get it.

647
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,255
He's a bad guy.

648
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:11,391
And right now he has the
Obelisk, which is a bad thing.

649
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,462
You know, I've spent all my life

650
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,797
wondering who he was and why he left.

651
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:20,701
But after today, I-I
just don't care anymore.

652
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:24,004
All I care about is that we stop him,

653
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,140
and I just wanted to let you know that

654
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,879
- whatever it takes to do that, I'm in.
- That's good to know.

655
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:33,247
If we're gonna do this,

656
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,983
you have to be completely
honest with me from now on ...

657
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,753
no more secrets, no more
compartmentalization,

658
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,155
and definitely no more hidden cameras.

659
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:44,391
Whatever's going on, you
bring me in ... no exceptions.

660
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:47,528
- Okay.
- Okay.

661
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:50,965
We should probably get started.

662
00:39:55,003 --> 00:39:56,337
[beeps]

663
00:39:56,404 --> 00:39:58,305
[whirring]

664
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:09,183
So, this is what you've
been doing up here.

665
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:14,588
- Well, it's what I did yesterday.
- You're kidding.

666
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:18,726
I don't know how else to explain it,
but it needs to be carved.

667
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:21,262
Does ... does it just
appear in your mind,

668
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,099
- like some sort of vision?
- No. It just...

669
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,369
kind of happens,
which is really frustrating

670
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:30,738
because no matter how much I carve,

671
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:34,275
it still means nothing to me.
I don't even have a theory.

672
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,646
I do.

673
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,785
It's a map.

674
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:47,600
The lab should be
dismantled within the hour.

675
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,169
- And the rest of the facility?
- Not long after. [elevator bell dings]

676
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:55,174
I couldn't help but notice
all the moving boxes.

677
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,847
I'm sorry for the interruption.

678
00:40:57,882 --> 00:41:00,211
- This will only take a second.
- Remove him!

679
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,821
Please, lower your voice.

680
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,542
Let's all ... Let's all try
and keep our heads about us.

681
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:06,552
Let's all try and stay calm.

682
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,787
[grunts]

683
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:11,223
[grunting]

684
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,899
Mm. Sorry.

685
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:21,567
[squeaking]

686
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:23,824
Let's all try and keep
our heads about us.

687
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,908
[sighs]

688
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:33,509
I hear you've been looking for this.

689
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,518
The Obelisk.

690
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:42,955
In its native language,
it's called the Diviner,

691
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:47,126
one of many little details
I know about this thing.

692
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:49,311
Can you tell me how to use it?

693
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:53,182
Better yet, I'll teach
you how to survive it.

694
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:56,051
And why would you do that?

695
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,570
We share a common enemy ...
a guy named Phil Coulson.

696
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:06,762
I thought maybe together,
you and I could kill him...

697
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:12,133
...along with, you know, everyone else.

698
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,305
